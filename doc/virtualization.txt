Device virtualization protocol
------------------------------

 - Any virtualization messages get a VIRTUALIZATION protocol flag for easy detection and filtering.

Protocol (within the message):

LIST OF [
    2-byte unique device ID (sensor if inbound to MCU, actuator otherwise)
    N 32-bit floating-point values, where N is fixed based on the device ID
]

The idea is to benefit from WiFi's large packet frames in order to manage many virtualized devices as once without swamping the microcontroller with too many packets to process.
