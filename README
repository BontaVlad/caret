This is an experiment for running Nim code on the ESP8266 ("NodeMCU") microcontroller.

Seriously WIP and needs a Nim compiler hack for the GC and to add support for the XTensa CPU.

Not meant to be used by others at this time.

TODO
----

 - I want my main() back, what is libmain.a doing with it exactly?
 - Finish implementing GPIO and timer (?) modules
 - use correct linker script for full memory utilization? maybe the linker script should be included too
